The Next Generation Archive System Management Portal
====================================================

NOTE: This README file is not meant to describe the system in any detail.

NGAS is a very feature rich, archive handling and management system.
In its core it is a HTTP based object storage system. It can be deployed
on single small servers, or in globally distributed clusters. It supports
installation on many *IX flavors supporting Python. The implementation
is pure Python, but there are a few dependencies on C libraries as well
and that may restrict the ability to install it on some of the more exotic
platforms. Once installed, the NGAS server is intended to run as a daemon.
It is possible to run more than one server on a single host and it is
possible to run many servers across hundreds of nodes as well as across
various sites. The more advanced features allow mirroring of sites running
independent NGAS clusters, but it is also possible to run multiple clusters
against a central database.

The system has been originally developed and used extensively at the
European Southern Observatory to archive the data at the observatories in
Chile and mirror the data to the headquarters in Germany. It has also been
deployed at the NRAO in Socorro and Charlottesville and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is using the system to collect the data
directly at the control site in the Chilean Andes and then distribute the data
to Santiago and further on to the ALMA regional centers in the US, Japan and
Germany. NGAS is controlling millions of files all around the world and it
is scaling very well. The version of NGAS delivered in this distribution is
a branch of the original ALMA version. It had been further developed and
adopted to deal with the much higher data rate of the Murchison Widefield
Array (MWA) and quite some work went into the installation and automatic test
features.

This part of the system provides a web based management user interface to
NGAS. In fact it is almost exclusively talking to the NGAS database to
perform its functions. The management portal comes in two flavors, but
only the ngas_zope_portal one had been used in an operational environment.
As the name suggests that latter portal is based on the Zope2 web framework.
The Management portal provides mostly form based query access to the NGAS
database tables. This allows management users to search for files, disks and
NGAS servers. It is NOT meant to serve as an end-user interface, since that
should be provided through a proper science interface. In normal NGAS
deployments, the NGAS layer is in general completely hidden and not visible
to the users.

The ngas_django_portal is a new implementation of the same functionality
using the Django web framework. This was a student internship project and
is currently not recommended for an operational environment. The intention
of this version is to provided a starting point for people to integrate
the NGAS management portal into an existing Django based portal. Since
Django is a lot more popular than Zope that might in fact be the future
of the main-stream NGAS management portal as well. At the time of this
writing it is more of a case study.
