NGAS Portal Installation Guide
==============================

NOTE: Still not completely automatic, but getting close.

fab -f src/deploy.py test_deploy

this will launch an EC2 instance create the user ngas and install Zope2 and the NGAS site content.

After that it is still required to login to the instance and patch the SQLAlchemyDA and import the NGAS.zexp into the running server.

>>> Modified the SQLAlchemyDA around line 248 to return 1 if the getPool method does not work.
vi lib/python2.7/site-packages/Products.SQLAlchemyDA-0.5.1-py2.7.egg/Products/SQLAlchemyDA/da.py


Launching the server as user ngas:

ngas_portal/ngas/bin/zopectl start
