NGAS Portal Installation Guide
==============================

NOTE: Still not completely automatic, but getting close.

fab -f src/deploy.py test_deploy

this will launch an EC2 instance create the user ngas and install Zope2 and the NGAS site content.

After that it is still required to login to the instance and import the NGAS.zexp into the running server.


Launching the server as user ngas:

ngas_portal/ngas/bin/zopectl start
